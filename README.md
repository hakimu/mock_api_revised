## To run the program, run...

```
ruby input_org.rb
```

The `api_input_options.rb` file is not fully functional.  I decided to try and implement `optparse` at the last minute but had trouble sending data to the URL properly.  For example, only the first number was being passed.  I had the same issue trying to use ARGV so I ended up hard coding the call to generate the input and call the API in the `input_org.rb` file.

Run `rake test` to run a few tests.

I hope to have the opportunity to discuss my submission with the team.
